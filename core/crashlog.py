"""Persistent crash log that survives the frozen-build stderr drop.

PyInstaller one-file builds capture ``sys.stderr`` into a handle that is
discarded after process exit — any ``print(..., file=sys.stderr)`` during
shutdown is effectively lost. That's where the most interesting
late-binding warnings live (worker threads that refuse to join, partial
output unlinks, finaliser exceptions), so we need a durable sink.

This module appends short human-readable lines to a file in the OS
user-data directory. Never raises — every operation is wrapped so a
broken filesystem path or ENOSPC can't turn "we wanted to log a warning"
into "we crashed the app harder".

Path selection (first match wins):
    $VERTIGO_CRASH_LOG           explicit override (tests, CI, users)
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\\Vertigo\\crash.log   Windows
    ~/Library/Logs/Vertigo/crash.log     macOS
    $XDG_STATE_HOME/vertigo/crash.log    Linux (XDG base dir spec)
    ~/.local/state/vertigo/crash.log     Linux fallback

PyInstaller's ``_MEIPASS`` staging dir is explicitly never used — it's
read-only in one-file builds and wiped on exit anyway, so logging there
would defeat the whole point.
