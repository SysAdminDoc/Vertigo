"""Shared lazy-install helper for opt-in ``core/*`` modules.

Vertigo's optional integrations (faster-whisper, silero-vad, pycaps,
boxmot, pyannote, keybert, katna, lighthouse, etc.) are heavy, so each
module follows the same ``is_installed() -> bool`` / ``ensure_installed()
-> bool`` contract and pip-installs on first use.

Until v0.12.0 every module carried its own private ``_try_pip_install``
helper that shelled out to ``[sys.executable, "-m", "pip", ...]``. In a
PyInstaller build ``sys.executable`` is ``Vertigo.exe`` itself, so a
missing opt-in dep would have relaunched the GUI recursively — the same
fork-bomb class that ``vertigo.py::_pip_install`` already guards
against. This module collapses eight copies into one guarded helper.

The public surface is intentionally tiny:

    * :func:`is_frozen` — one source of truth for the frozen check.
    * :func:`pip_install` — the only place that spawns pip.

Tests monkey-patch :data:`_pip_runner` to simulate both success and
failure without actually reaching the network.
