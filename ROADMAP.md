# Vertigo — Roadmap

Prioritized from a three-stream competitive research pass against the
2026 OSS vertical-video / caption / auto-clip landscape. Each item has
an honest impact × effort estimate, a source project, and a licensing
note. Items are ordered within each tier by ROI.

Ticked items shipped in the matching version.

---

## Tier 1 · Captions leap — ship-this-sprint [~6–10 h]

Goal: move captions from *acceptable* to *best-in-class for 9:16*.

- [x] **T1a · Mobile-correct defaults** · ~1 h · v0.8.0
  Font size `height / 22` (≈ 87 pt at 1080 p), bottom margin `0.20 ×
  height`, 2-line × ≤ 18-char wrap, 3–4-word chunks capped at 1.2 s.
  2026 creator-tool consensus (CapCut / Opus / Submagic / Descript).

- [x] **T1b · Caption preset system** · ~3 h · v0.8.0
  `CaptionPreset` dataclass + `QComboBox` with live preview. Six
  bundled looks: *Clean · Pop · Karaoke · Bold Yellow · Neon Outline
  · Classic*. Replaces the single hard-coded ASS block.

- [x] **T1c · Word-level karaoke** · ~3 h · v0.8.0 · stable-ts (MIT)
  Flip `faster-whisper` to `word_timestamps=True` (no new deps) and
  port `stable_whisper/text_output.py::result_to_ass` so each word
  gets a `\kf` fill-sweep. libass renders it through the existing
  `subtitles=` filter.

---

## Tier 2 · Smart-track quality — next sprint [~8–12 h]

Goal: lift Smart Track from "naive piecewise-lerp" to "competitive
with `mutonby/openshorts` while keeping Vertigo's uniquely fast
expression-driven crop + 4-backend hardware encoding".

- [x] **T2b · Savitzky-Golay trajectory smoothing** · ~1 h · v0.8.0 · `scipy`
  Single `savgol_filter(x_series, window_length=odd(fps·0.5),
  polyorder=3)` call before emitting the FFmpeg `x(t)` expression.
  Kills micro-jitter; scipy already a MediaPipe transitive.

- [x] **T2c · VFR → CFR pre-pass + audio start-time fix** · ~2 h · v0.8.0
  Every competitor silently ships an audio-drift bug on VFR sources
  and streams with non-zero `start_time`. `ffprobe` compares
  `r_frame_rate` vs `avg_frame_rate`; if they differ, normalise to
  CFR. Video `start_time` is fed as `-ss` on the audio extract.
  **License caveat:** `Autocrop-vertical` has no LICENSE →
  re-implement from the public `ffprobe` technique, do not copy.

- [x] **T2a · `SmoothedCameraman` + `SpeakerTracker` port** · ~4–6 h · v0.8.0 · openshorts (MIT)
  Two classes, ~300 LoC total. Safe-zone hysteresis (viewport holds
  still while subject stays within 25 % of crop width), speed-adaptive
  motion (3 px/f normal, 15 px/f for > 50 % jumps, overshoot clamp),
  ID-sticky speaker tracking (exp. decay 0.85/f, 3× sticky bonus,
  30-frame switch cool-down).

- [x] **T2d · `--plan-only` dry-run** · ~1–2 h · v0.8.0
  Print the per-scene `TRACK / LETTERBOX / CENTER` strategy table
  without encoding. QA/preview feature in the sidebar before
  committing a long encode.

---

## Tier 3 · Narrow auto-highlight funnel [~6–10 h]

Scope call: *segment proposals + shot-aware trimming + hook-energy*
is a natural upstream extension that funnels into the existing
single-clip editor. *LLM-viral-scoring + thumbnails + uploads* is
OpusClip's lane — every OSS attempt is mediocre. Build the former,
never the latter.

- [x] **T3a · Shot-snap on trim timeline** · ~3 h · v0.9.0 · existing PySceneDetect
  Scope changed from transnetv2-pytorch to the PySceneDetect we
  already ship — 500 MB PyTorch dep wasn't worth the +4 % F1. New
  `SceneWorker` runs on every clip load; `RangeSlider` draws
  subtle tick marks at each cut and magnet-snaps trim handles
  within 200 ms. Scene list also reused by Smart Track so the
  inline pass is skipped when the background worker has finished.

- [x] **T3b · Segment proposals via TextTiling** · ~3 h · v0.12.0 · stdlib+numpy (no ClipsAI dep)
  Stream the already-cached faster-whisper word list through a local
  TextTiling-style lexical-cohesion scorer (no new dependency — the
  upstream ClipsAI fork is MIT but its dep chain drags in WhisperX /
  torch). Emits candidate 30–90 s segments ranked by `?`-count,
  laughter tokens (`haha`, `[laughter]`), and silence-gap
  heuristics, surfaced via a **"Suggest segments"** trim-row button
  that pops a ranked candidate menu. **Stop before the LLM step** —
  charter-compliant; no ranking via LLM prompt, all signals are
  local.

## Tier 6 · v0.12.0 production hardening (factory-loop audit findings)

- [x] **H1 · Unify opt-in `_try_pip_install` + add frozen-build guard** · v0.12.0
  All eight opt-in modules (`core/subtitles.py`, `core/vad.py`,
  `core/animated_captions.py`, `core/tracker_boxmot.py`,
  `core/highlights.py`, `core/keyframes.py`, `core/diarize.py`,
  `core/broll.py`) carried a duplicated `_try_pip_install(spec)`
  helper that invoked `[sys.executable, "-m", "pip", ...]` with no
  `_is_frozen()` short-circuit. In a PyInstaller build
  `sys.executable` is `Vertigo.exe`, so any missing opt-in dep
  would have relaunched the GUI recursively — the same fork-bomb
  class that `vertigo.py::_pip_install()` already guards against.
  Consolidate into `core/_lazy.py::pip_install()` with a single
  frozen-build guard + a `_pip_install_disabled` hook used by the
  regression test so the frozen path is verifiable. Drop eight
  copies of the helper in favour of the shared one.

- [x] **H2 · Regression test for fork-bomb guard** · v0.12.0
  `tests/test_lazy_install.py` — monkey-patches `sys.frozen = True`
  and asserts every module's `ensure_installed()` returns `False`
  without ever constructing a subprocess command. Also asserts the
  non-frozen path is wired to a mockable install hook. Pins the H1
  fix so a future re-introduction of the duplicated helper fails
  the test suite.

## Tier 7 · v0.12.1 audit-cycle hardening

- [x] **H3 · `_on_pycaps_failed` resilient to missing `_info`** · v0.12.1
  If the user removes the loaded clip mid-export, `_on_pycaps_failed`
  hits `self.win._info.path` on a `None` window info, raises
  `AttributeError`, and `_finish_export_done` never runs — UI stuck
  in the export-busy state (cancel button hidden, export button
  hidden, status stuck at "Applying animated captions…"). Fall back
  to the cached temp-reframed path or an empty `Path()` and always
  reach the finaliser.

- [x] **H4 · Worker-handle null-out consistency** · v0.12.1
  Every `_on_*_ready` / `_on_*_failed` slot should null the worker
  handle (`self.x_worker = None`) so the `QThread` reference drops
  immediately after completion. Current behaviour pins the object
  until the next run of the same worker replaces it. The v0.12.0
  `segments_worker` already does this; apply to `highlights_worker`,
  `auto_edit_worker`, `vad_worker`, `pycaps_worker`.

- [x] **H5 · Real cancel cooperation for segment proposals** · v0.12.1
  `SegmentProposalsWorker.cancel()` currently just flips a flag the
  synchronous `propose_segments` never checks. On very long
  transcripts (hours-long dashcam / lecture clips) the user-cancel
  does not actually stop the sweep. Thread a `cancel_cb` through
  `propose_segments` and check it at each outer loop head
  (`_boundaries`, `_assemble_segments`, `_score_segment`).

- [x] **H6 · Extract `Caption` / `Word` to `core/caption_types.py`** · v0.12.1
  `core/segment_proposals.py` only needs the `Caption` dataclass
  shape yet its import chain drags `caption_layout`, `caption_styles`,
  and `face_samples` through `core/subtitles.py`. Lift the two
  dataclasses out; re-export from `core/subtitles.py` for binary
  compatibility.

- [x] **H7 · `on_subs_cleared` must drop `clip_captions` + refresh segments button** · v0.12.1
  Clearing the SRT from the subtitles panel does not drop the
  cached caption list, so the Suggest-segments button stays enabled
  against stale data. Clear both, then call
  `refresh_segments_button()` so the gate re-evaluates.

- [x] **H8 · Coverage: `_gap_before` / `_gap_after` regression** · v0.12.1
  The v0.12.0 L4 pass rewrote both helpers to find the straddling
  pair; no direct unit-test pinned that fix (the only assertion was
  indirect via reasons-string). Add direct tests.

## Tier 8 · v0.12.3 polish + perf (factory-loop iter 1)

- [x] **R1 · Prune stray audit PNGs from repo root** · v0.12.3
  `_polish_iconstrip.png` / `_polish_modes.png` pre-date the
  `_*.png` gitignore rule and are intermediate QA artifacts long
  superseded by `assets/screenshots/`. Delete both, verify no
  README / CHANGELOG / assets reference survives.

- [x] **R2 · `WORKER_CANCELLED_MSG` constant** · v0.12.3
  "Cancelled." appears as a magic string in nine non-test files (six
  worker modules, three controller slots, `core/animated_captions`).
  Move into `workers/__init__.py` (no import cycle) so a future
  rename is a one-line change. Tests that pin the literal value
  still pass — the runtime string is unchanged.

- [x] **R3 · Shutdown warning via `core/crashlog.py`** · v0.12.3
  `ui/main_controller.py:197` prints a worker-hang warning to
  `sys.stderr`. Frozen PyInstaller builds discard stderr; the line
  is effectively lost. Add a tiny `core/crashlog.py` that appends to
  the user-data dir (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Vertigo\\crash.log`,
  `~/.local/share/vertigo/crash.log`, `~/Library/Logs/Vertigo/`).
  No-op safe, non-blocking, frozen-safe (not `_MEIPASS`).

- [x] **R4 · Cache captions-has-text gate** · v0.12.3
  `refresh_segments_button` currently does `any(c.text.strip() ...)`
  on every click / queue update. On a 2-hour lecture transcript this
  is 20k+ character scans per UI refresh. Store a `bool` alongside
  `clip_captions` and read that flag.

- [x] **R5 · Bisect-based `_gap_before` / `_gap_after`** · v0.12.3

## Tier 9 · v0.12.3 iter 2 — multilingual + observability parity

- [x] **R6 · Multilingual stop-list for segment proposals** · v0.12.3
  `_STOP_WORDS` is English-only, so TextTiling cohesion on a French or
  German transcript over-counts every `le` / `la` / `der` / `die` and
  produces poor boundaries. Extend with es/fr/de/pt/it sibling
  frozensets unioned into the main set. Charter-safe: no new deps, no
  NLTK, the lists fit in-source.

- [x] **R7 · Route `_lazy.py` pip failures through crashlog** · v0.12.3
  `core/_lazy.py:95` still uses the same `print(..., file=sys.stderr)`
  pattern R3 just removed from `main_controller.shutdown`. Frozen
  builds drop stderr, so the final-failure breadcrumb vanishes exactly
  when forensic value is highest. Same fix — route through
  `core.crashlog.append`.

- [x] **R8 · Harmonize crashlog path with `vertigo.py::_log_dir`** · v0.12.3
  `core/crashlog.py` lowercases the Linux app dir (`vertigo/`) while
  the bootstrap writes to `Vertigo/` — bootstrap-time fatal errors and
  runtime breadcrumbs land in different files. Capitalise the Linux
  path, add the APPDATA fallback on Windows, and honour the same
  TEMP fallback on mkdir failure.
  Linear scan over every caption once per `_score_segment` call →
  O(N*M) on long transcripts (~100k comparisons on a two-hour clip).
  `bisect_left` / `bisect_right` on sorted caption-end / caption-start
  arrays gives O(log N) per lookup, preserving the straddling-pair
  return semantics (covered by the H8 regression tests).

- [x] **T3c · Hook-energy score** · ~1 h · v0.9.0 · no new deps
  `core/hook_score.py` produces a 0–100 "first-3-second" score from
  FFmpeg-extracted 16 kHz mono PCM + per-frame RMS/ZCR voice
  heuristic. Surfaced in the dry-run report as `Hook (first 3s)`.
  Deliberately ignored the `librosa + silero-vad` suggestion — no
  need for torch just to RMS a 3-second window.

---

## Tier 4 · Power-user opt-in [gated behind toggles]

- [x] **T4a · Face-aware caption positioning** · ~4 h · v0.10.0 · MediaPipe (already pulled)
  Sample 2 fps, emit `{\an8}` top-center override on Dialogue lines when
  a detected face would be occluded by the default bottom-center caption
  zone. Falls back to safe-area default when no face overlap is found.
  Blur Letterbox mode is exempt (captions land on the blurred bar, no
  subject to occlude). Forces ASS output for non-karaoke presets since
  SRT can't carry per-line positioning. Opt-in toggle on the Captions
  tab.

- [~] **T4b · Pyannote speaker diarization** · v0.11.0 · WhisperX (BSD-2) + pyannote (MIT)
  `core.diarize` module landed with `diarize()` + `align_to_faces()`;
  UI wiring deferred because it requires a HuggingFace token +
  terms-acceptance flow. Users who opt in can drive the module
  directly.

- [x] **T4c · Lighthouse moment-retrieval** · v0.11.0 · line/lighthouse (Apache-2)
  `core.highlights.score_spans(path, query=None)` ships with a
  Lighthouse-primary / audio-energy-fallback implementation. Wired
  into the "Find highlights" trim button — pops a ranked menu of
  candidate moments; picking one drops the trim handles in place.

## Tier 5 · Optional integrations landed in v0.11.0

- [x] **Silero VAD silence trim** · `core.vad` + "Tighten to speech"
  trim-row button. ONNX (no PyTorch), <2 MB. Pulls the handles to
  the outer speech edges with 100 ms pad.
- [x] **auto-editor silence cut planner** · `core.auto_edit` + "Trim
  silences" trim-row button. Subprocess into the `auto-editor` CLI
  with `--export json`; pops a menu of the longest speech-contiguous
  sections.
- [x] **BoxMOT speaker-ID tracking** · `core.tracker_boxmot` +
  `make_tracker()` factory inside `FaceTracker.track_with_cameraman`.
  Installing `boxmot` silently upgrades Smart Track to BoT-SORT /
  ByteTrack / DeepOCSORT; AGPL-3.0 (desktop builds fine, SaaS triggers).
- [x] **RetargetVid clustering filter** · `core.cluster_track`
  temporal-persistence filter on per-frame face observations.
  Two-pass Smart Track pipeline drops single-frame noise before
  cameraman smoothing sees it. Pure numpy.
- [x] **pycaps animated captions** · `core.animated_captions`
  `render_composited()` drives `CapsPipelineBuilder` as a post-encode
  pass. Six curated pycaps templates exposed in the Subtitles panel
  style picker.
- [x] **Katna keyframe export** · `core.keyframes` + "Export
  thumbnails" hero-header button. Katna-ranked when installed, cv2
  evenly-spaced fallback always available.
- [~] **B-roll auto-insertion** · `core.broll` planner module
  (KeyBERT + Pexels + CLIP); UI deferred because Pexels requires a
  free API key / signup. Planner is importable for users who want
  to drive it programmatically.

## Skip-list — all three research streams converged on these

| Item | Why skip |
|---|---|
| `linto-ai/whisper-timestamped` | **AGPL-3.0** — poisons Vertigo's MIT licence. |
| `gauravzazz/smart-reframe` | 0 stars, 1 commit, empty README. Dead. |
| `IORoot/AI__autoflip` | Stale Docker wrapper around Google AutoFlip. |
| `bmezaris/RetargetVid` direct port | Dead since 2022, TF1 + CUDA + UNISAL. Only the scipy-smoothing idea is borrowable (T2b). |
| Copying `kamilstanuch/Autocrop-vertical` source | No LICENSE file → legally all-rights-reserved. Re-implement public techniques only. |
| `whisper.cpp` swap | Loses `faster-whisper`'s Python word-timestamp API, adds binary build step. |
| `moviepy` caption burn | Slower than libass via `subtitles=`. |
| AutoShot over TransNetV2 | +4 % F1 isn't worth research-code integration pain. |
| LLM-based "viral moment" scoring | Coin flip + API cost. Every OSS clone ships it; all are mediocre. Ship proposals; let users pick. |
| Full OBS auto-highlight plugin | Zero OSS precedent worth forking, out of scope. |

## What Vertigo already does better than every audited competitor

- Hardware-encoder auto-detect across **4 backends** (NVENC / QSV /
  AMF / VideoToolbox). Autocrop-vertical has 2; openshorts has 0.
- Single expression-driven `crop=w:h:x(t):0` — every other project
  re-encodes via raw BGR24 pipe, ~2–4× slower.
- **Four** explicit reframe modes including Manual Crop — no
  competitor has this.
- PyQt6 batch queue + trim timeline + colour grading + text overlay
  editor — all competitors are CLI or web.
- Turnkey bootstrap, frameless premium UI, three themes, painted
  mode-card icons, focus-state-without-layout-shift — UX-wise none
  of the competition is close.
